# Three Level Exapandable List View

This is boiler plate code to implement 3-level exapandable list view in Android. This code will work with dynamic data, an
extension of its [gist](https://gist.github.com/st-f/2b2a838d3f0258c5c33f) which works only on static string text values.

![Demo gif](/ThreeLevelListview/app/src/main/res/raw/sample.gif?raw=true "Demo")


- Code is not using ViewHolder pattern hence it is not recycled.
- Code is not memory efficient.

## Getting Started

- Download or clone project
- Define parent array for main category, parent is top level list.
```
    String[] parent = new String[]{"MOVIES", "GAMES"};
```
- Define array for genre (subcategory) for each parent category added this is level 2, eg: 
```
   String[] movies = new String[]{"Horror", "Action", "Thriller/Drama"}
   String[] games = new String[]{"Fps", "Moba", "Rpg", "Racing"};

```

- Define level 3 elements in separate arrays:
```
 
    String[] horror = new String[]{"Conjuring", "Insidious", "The Ring"};
   
    String[] action = new String[]{"Jon Wick", "Die Hard", "Fast 7", "Avengers"};
    
    String[] thriller = new String[]{"Imitation Game", "Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy", "Inception", "Manchester by the Sea"};

    String[] fps = new String[]{"CS: GO", "Team Fortress 2", "Overwatch", "Battlefield 1", "Halo II", "Warframe"};
   
    String[] moba = new String[]{"Dota 2", "League of Legends", "Smite", "Strife", "Heroes of the Storm"};
    
    String[] rpg = new String[]{"Witcher III", "Skyrim", "Warcraft", "Mass Effect II", "Diablo", "Dark Souls", "Last of Us"};
    
    String[] racing = new String[]{"NFS: Most Wanted", "Forza Motorsport 3", "EA: F1 2016", "Project Cars"};


```
- Define a ```secondLevel``` ArrayList, this will be used as key data to fetch arrays accross levels.

- Define LinkedHasMap for each subcategory where key is subcategory name, and value is a string array,

```
    LinkedHashMap<String, String[]> thirdLevelMovies = new LinkedHashMap<>();

    LinkedHashMap<String, String[]> thirdLevelGames = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    
    ...now putting it all together
    
        secondLevel.add(movies);
        secondLevel.add(games);
        
        thirdLevelMovies.put(movies[0], horror);
        thirdLevelMovies.put(movies[1], action);
        thirdLevelMovies.put(movies[2], thriller);
        
        thirdLevelGames.put(games[0], fps);
        thirdLevelGames.put(games[1], moba);
        thirdLevelGames.put(games[2], rpg);
        thirdLevelGames.put(games[3], racing);
        
        data.add(thirdLevelMovies);
        data.add(thirdLevelGames);
        
        expandableListView = (ExpandableListView) findViewById(R.id.expandible_listview);
        ParentLevel parentLevelAdapter = new ParentLevel(this, parent, secondLevel, data);
        expandableListView.setAdapter(parentLevelAdapter);   
    

```





## Built Using
- Android Studio 2.3.2
- Min SDK 16, Target SDK 25
- Build Tools 25.0.3
- Gradle 2.3.2

*Code will work fine as long as above configurations are met.*

*You will need to possibly edit code if you change min sdks etc.*
